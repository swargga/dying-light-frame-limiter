# Frame Limiter For Dying Light 1
This piece of software lets you avoid damage in certain animations, which can come in pretty handy in PVP!

# Is it counted as 'LEGIT'?
Yes, it's fully legit. The only thing it does is handles when to freeze/unfreeze the process.

# How can I use it?
For example, you miss a tackle and there is a guy trying to hit you with a 2-handed weapon...

You just hold down the Freeze Lag button for some time and you will receive minimal damage since you're still in animation because of the lag.
